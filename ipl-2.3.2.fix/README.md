Ibis is an open source Java grid software project of the Computer
Systems group of the Computer Science department of the Faculty of
Sciences at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The
main goal of the Ibis project is to create an efficient Java-based
platform for grid computing.

This release contains the Ibis communication library (defined
by the Ibis Portability Layer (IPL)) and several implementations of this
IPL. Some example applications are provided in the "examples"
directory.

Building the IPL is easy: on Unix, execute the included "gradlew" script,
on Windows execute "gradlew.bat".

The users's guide in the docs directory ("docs/usersguide.pdf") explains
how to compile and run your Ibis application.

The programmer's manual ("docs/progman.pdf") contains a detailed
description of the Ibis Application Programmer's interface (API),
illustrated with example code fragments.

The javadoc of Ibis is available in "javadoc/index.html".

Ibis has its own web-site: http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis/.  There, you can
find more Ibis documentation, papers, application sources.

The current Ibis  source repository tree is accessible at GitHub:
"https://github.com/junglecomputing/ipl".

There is some dispute about the pronounciation of the word "Ibis". The
file "docs/rob.mp3" shows how one of the Ibis designers feels about this
issue.
